Weather App
This app is made to get the current weather of the given city. App shows several kinds of 
data, such as the descryption of the weather (sunny, clear sky, rainy and etc.), humidity
(in persentage), and of course the temperature and  the name of the city, date and the time.

Guide for Beginners:
This is the first app which I made, and for the first time I used Android Studio. To tell the
truth till the start the only thing (from what is used in process of developing this app)
what I knew about (what I *heard* about before :)) was layout. But I knew this is one of the
easiest things what is able to do an Android Developer, like a fruity salad means for a 
Professional Chef.This is just a leaf of General Sherman(the biggest tree in the world).

So, the idea was, doing a requst to OpenWeatherAPI by using Okhttp, and to display the answer 
by reading it with org.json*API. And what I did is the "Advice of the age" - googled. Googled in 
various ways, and the first question was "how to make a weather app for android" - predictable, 
isn't it?) Read couple of manuals, tutorials, and documentations. Browsed tens of variants of the
projects and codes, sorted and chose those which are more understandable for me, and started to 
write. For the beginning I simplified the task - displaying only the most important thing for the
weather app, temperature in the exact city on a current time. And while the process, by analyzing
what I'm doing, started to add more information, and then I decided to check on a device, but here
it goes... "app keeps stopping error", empty display and so on. First error I solved by reading 
forums, but the second was too awaitable. It wasn't error at all, it was just white data on a 
white background)), and I added the background by entering a little change to an xml file, as
follows I changed the default launcher logo to another one which found on the internet. 
And yeap, it works!). 
That's all I wanted to tell about to you - Developer, who is just beginning, with a huge plans 
and ambitions... Good Luck, a future developer(near future)!
